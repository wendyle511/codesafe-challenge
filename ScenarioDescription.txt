Coding challenge scenario:
You are building a tiny login system for an internal Codesafe tool.
  -Users type a username and password in the terminal.
  -The system checks the credentials against a small in-memory user database.
  -Every login attempt is written to a security log so developers can debug problems.

Problem:
Right now, the program logs the raw password that the user typed.
This is dangerous because:
  -Anyone who can see the logs can see real passwords.
  -People often reuse passwords on other websites.
  -Logs might be stored for a long time or copied to other systems.

Your job is to fix the logging so that passwords are never stored in the logs, while keeping the login behavior the same.
The learner must:
  1. find the security flaw in the python code
  2. Change the code so that:
    a. Login attempts are still logged 
    b. BUT the actual password never appears in any log entry
  3. Keep the same logic of logic of password usage:
    a. Correct username + correct password = login successes
    b. Wrong username or password = login failed
