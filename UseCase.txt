Use Case

UC13 - Secure Logging Challenge

Use Case Name: Secure Logging Challenge

Author: Simar Virk

Priority: High

Source:
- Case Study guidance on secure coding
- Elicitation Notes (10/23, 11/5) - logging and authentication constraints
- Scenarios on completing challenges & sandbox execution (SCN01, SCN02)

Short Description:
A learner completes a challenge that requires fixing insecure logging in a Python login program. The learner must remove sensitive data from log output while preserving program functionality and passing all test cases.

Goal(s):
- Teach learners how to reorganize insecure logging patterns.
- Ensure secure handling of password data.
- Reinforce real-world secure software development skills.

Primary Actor: Learner

Secondary Actors:
- DOJO Execution Environment
- Automated Grader
- Logging System

Preconditions:
- Learner is logged in.
- Challenge description, starter code, and test cases are available.
- The execution environment is operational.

Success End Condition:
- Learner submits a corrected version of the program that passes all tests and securely logs attempts without exposing passwords.

Failed End Condition:
- Passwords still appear in logs OR
- Authentication behavior is broken OR
- Test cases do not pass OR
- Challenge is not submitted successfully.

Trigger:
- Learner opens the Secure Logging Challenge in the Codesafe coding environment.

Basic Flow 
  1. Learner opens the coding environment for the Secure Logging Challenge.
  2. The system loads starter code, instructions, and test cases.
  3. Learner reviews the insecure logging implementation.
  4. Learner modifies the logging logic to remove or mask the password.
  5. Learner runs the test suite.
  6. The system executes test cases and shows results.
  7. Learner revises the implementation and reruns tests as needed.
  8. All tests pass, including those validating secure log output.
  9. Learner submits the corrected code.
  10. The system marks the challenge as “Completed.”

Alternative Flows
  3.a - Learner asks the AI chatbot for assistance
    - System opens AI panel (per UC10)
    - Chatbot provides conceptual guidance without revealing solutions.
    - Flow resumes at Step 4.
  5.a - Learner executes the code without submitting it
    - The system displays intermediate results.
    - The learner continues editing.
    - Flow resumes at Step 7.

Exception Flows
  5.b - Test cases fail due to insecure logging
    - System shows failure: “Sensitive data detected in logs.”
    - Learner reviews failure details and returns to Step 4.
  5.c - Test cases fail due to incorrect authentication logic
    - System shows which authentication checks failed.
    - Learner corrects logic and returns to Step 7.
  6.a - Sandbox execution error
    - System displays an execution error (SCN02)
    - Learner retries execution once the system is stable.
    - Flow resumes at Step 5.

Supplementary Information
- Logs may be used for analytics and debugging (per Field Notes)
- Password-handling rules align with secure software engineering standards.
- Use case complements UC03 - Complete Challenge but adds a security-specific constraint.
